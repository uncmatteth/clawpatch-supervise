# ClawPatch Supervise

> **🤬🦶💥 NEW AND FUCKING IMPROVED — NOW WITH MORE CURSING 🔨🗑️🔥**

Use the standalone supervisor as the outer runtime for a ClawPatch repair queue.

## Contract

- ClawPatch owns review, finding selection, repair, revalidation, and finding status.
- The supervisor owns ordering, watchdogs, exact checkpoints, commits, optional pushes, and completion proof.
- A zero-feature heuristic map is not completion; the supervisor must run ClawPatch's agent mapper before accepting an empty repository.
- Run the supervisor outside the target repository's implementation environment, even when the target is Manageroo itself.
- Never skip, triage, hide, or manually repair an unresolved ClawPatch finding.
- Never discard dirty source unless an exact supervisor checkpoint proves ownership.
- Treat both open and uncertain sandbox-limited revalidation as candidates for the bounded workspace-write and authorized trusted-host retry ladder before another fix call.
- Do not call an active queue complete. Require the final `COMPLETE` line and proof file.

## Workflow

1. Read the target repository's instructions and current Git state.
2. Verify `git`, Python 3.11+, `clawpatch --version`, and `clawpatch-supervise --version`.
3. Check for another supervisor or ClawPatch process targeting the same repository.
4. Choose one start mode:
   - normal invocation to preserve and process the existing `.clawpatch` queue;
   - accept the interactive reset prompt only when the existing queue and project source are clean;
   - `--fresh` only as an explicit non-interactive clean-source reset;
   - `--resume-stopped` for the exact stopped checkpoint already on disk.
5. Run one repository at a time with an explicit absolute path, branch policy, push policy, and watchdog.
6. If it stops, preserve the printed finding, paths, checkpoint, and source exactly. Relaunch with `--resume-stopped`; the supervisor can adopt a later applied ClawPatch repair only when its finding, base SHA, and complete source-path set match the stopped checkpoint boundary.
7. On completion, verify the proof file, clean Git state, local HEAD, and remote SHA when pushes were enabled.

Linux or macOS:

```bash
clawpatch-supervise --repo /absolute/path/to/repo --branch current \
  --push each --timeout-minutes 15
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
clawpatch-supervise --repo "C:\absolute\path\to\repo" --branch current `
  --push each --timeout-minutes 15
```

Resume only an exact stopped attempt:

```text
clawpatch-supervise --repo <absolute-path> --branch current --push each --timeout-minutes 15 --resume-stopped
```

Find the external checkpoint and proof directory:

```text
clawpatch-supervise --repo <absolute-path> --print-state-path
```

## Output

Human-facing phase banners are intentionally blunt, profane, and emoji-heavy. Exact commands,
finding IDs, paths, commits, errors, JSON, exit classes, and completion proof stay unchanged.

Return:

- repository and branch;
- supervisor and ClawPatch versions;
- fresh or resumed mode;
- current finding and phase, or final `COMPLETE` result;
- exact stopped paths and exit class when incomplete;
- proof path, clean/dirty Git state, local SHA, and remote SHA when complete.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not replace the command-owned queue with a report-derived loop.
- Do not run `clawpatch next` to get around a stopped finding.
- Do not blindly rerun the same fix against an unchanged source tree. Open and uncertain revalidation first use the bounded writable/trusted-host ladder; a still-open result may inform up to two additional same-finding attempts.
- Do not reset an existing open queue. Default invocation preserves it. If `fix` exits `6` after source progress, the supervisor must checkpoint and revalidate that repair before another fix.
- Do not call completion unverifiable: successful completion retains `.clawpatch`, and `clawpatch status --json` must still work afterward.
- Do not commit unrelated or pre-existing changes.
- Do not run ClawPatch against Git submodule contents owned by third parties; fresh supervisor runs exclude Gitlinks automatically.
- Do not claim Windows or Linux support from source inspection alone; use the repository's cross-platform test results.

## Proof

Project and install instructions: https://github.com/uncmatteth/clawpatch-supervise

ClawHub page: https://clawhub.ai/uncmatteth/skills/clawpatch-supervise

The run is complete only when the supervisor exits `0`, writes a `status: COMPLETE` proof, reports zero open or uncertain findings after a fresh review generation, and leaves the repository in the expected Git state.
